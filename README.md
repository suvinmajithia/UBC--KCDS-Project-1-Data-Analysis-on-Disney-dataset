# UBC-KCDS:Project-1-Data-Analysis-on-Disney-dataset

📌 Overview
This project explores patterns and trends in Disney movie revenues through data analysis and visual storytelling. The goal is to identify correlations between genres and financial performance, applying principles of clean, reproducible data science.
The dataset, obtained from data.world, includes metadata for Disney movies such as release dates, production budgets, box office revenue, and genre classifications.

🔍 Objectives
1. Analyze trends in Disney movie revenues by genre and over time.
2. Investigate correlations between genre types and revenue outcomes.
3. Apply principles of reproducibility and unit testing to ensure code quality.
4. Communicate findings through visualizations and data storytelling.

🧠 Key Insights
1. Certain genres (e.g., animation and adventure) consistently outperform others in box office revenue.
2. Revenue performance shows strong correlation with genre, release year, and sequel status.
3. A reproducible analysis pipeline with unit-tested components enhances robustness and collaboration.
